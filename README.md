# GoWeb 🌐

GoWeb is a simple Go web framework that aims to only use the standard library. The overall file structure and
development flow is inspired by larger frameworks like Laravel. It is partially ready for smaller projects if you are
fine with getting your hands dirty, but I plan on having it ready to go for more serious projects when it hits version
2.0.
